# Basics

Projects are singular, but non-routine, events with precise objectives which must be achieved within a set timeframe. Projects are broken into a set of activities designed to fulfil the stated objectives. 


Project Management requires the organisation of people, equipment and procedures in an appropriate way to get a project completed within a set timeframe and budget. A Project Manager is responsible for the coordination of all these resources in order to achieve the project objective

The following need to be considered when planning a project

1. Purpose and aim of the project
2. Resources available both human and material
3. Costing, human and time constraints

The tasks, procedures or activities required to complete the project


Project management techniques are used by organisations because they ensure that organisational objectives and system objectives are being met in a timely, accurate, relevant and complete manner. They provide a way of controlling people, resources and procedures, and clearly identify the tasks that must be completed and the desired completion time


## Phases

1. Investigation
2. Planning and Design
3. Production/Execution
4. Monitoring/Eval

Investigation 
- commissioning of the project
- identify goals/aims
- investigate possible ways in which the project can be completed
- at this phase a project brief is provided to the project manager by top management


Planning and Design
- defining the exact purpose of the project and clearly defining the objectives
- breaking the project in smaller tasks
- estimating shortest/longest time to each activity
- identify key milestones and timelines to keep the project on schedule
- determine the sequence of activites and any constraints affecting sequence. like one activity can be depending on another or some specific resource is required before starting an activity
- deciding which activites should be started before others
- identify which activites can be done in parallel or must be done in same time
- assigning resources, people, equipment
- prepare a timeline of events


Production/Execution
- providing all resources
- keeping track and completing activites
- comparing process with schedule
- updating/refinding schedule as required
- looking at budgets and keeping track of blowouts
- keeping track of milestones and overall goals

Evaluation/Monitor
- where the objective's met
- budget
- timelines
