# Basics

Projects are singular, but non-routine, events with precise objectives which must be achieved within a set timeframe. Projects are broken into a set of activities designed to fulfil the stated objectives. 


Project Management requires the organisation of people, equipment and procedures in an appropriate way to get a project completed within a set timeframe and budget. A Project Manager is responsible for the coordination of all these resources in order to achieve the project objective

The following need to be considered when planning a project

1. Purpose and aim of the project
2. Resources available both human and material
3. Costing, human and time constraints

The tasks, procedures or activities required to complete the project


Project management techniques are used by organisations because they ensure that organisational objectives and system objectives are being met in a timely, accurate, relevant and complete manner. They provide a way of controlling people, resources and procedures, and clearly identify the tasks that must be completed and the desired completion time


## Phases

1. Investigation
2. Planning and Design
3. Production/Execution
4. Monitoring/Eval

Investigation 
- commissioning of the project
- identify goals/aims
- investigate possible ways in which the project can be completed
- at this phase a project brief is provided to the project manager by top management


Planning and Design
- defining the exact purpose of the project and clearly defining the objectives
- breaking the project in smaller tasks
- estimating shortest/longest time to each activity
- identify key milestones and timelines to keep the project on schedule
- determine the sequence of activites and any constraints affecting sequence. like one activity can be depending on another or some specific resource is required before starting an activity
- deciding which activites should be started before others
- identify which activites can be done in parallel or must be done in same time
- assigning resources, people, equipment
- prepare a timeline of events


Production/Execution
- providing all resources
- keeping track and completing activites
- comparing process with schedule
- updating/refinding schedule as required
- looking at budgets and keeping track of blowouts
- keeping track of milestones and overall goals

Evaluation/Monitor
- where the objective's met
- budget
- timelines


### Tools

Gantt Chart - mainly showing time/costs across tasks. and showing which task can be completed first/second and parallel
Pert Diagram - more into showing relationship between activites

consider each task seperatly, look at historial data also if there else use subject matter experts/ your own experiance
documentation is important at every stage


# SDLC

## Analysis Phase

To gather data and do analysis on the feasablity of the project. 
identify & define the problem we are trying to solve clearly
focus should not be on identifing the problem and what would solve it. not going into how to solve the problem.

identify constraints (feasibility study), like 3rd part systems, staffing issue, budget issues, time issues etc these all will go into feasiblity study. does company have ability to create such a system. does company have ability to maintain and operate the system. will the development costs justify the improvement. 

define project team (who will provide input at design stage)

define information needs (need to talk to users of the system at different level to understand and analytics different information flow/needs. important to talk to actual users not just management. information relevent/bias/weightage should be taken into account as well)

information flow needs to be defined (data flow diagrams, ER diagrams)

define performance criteria
define a design proposal

## Design Phase

prepare system design
identify and evaluate alternate designs
selecting best configuration
prepare execution plan

## Execution phase

annoucement to start the project information stake holder, employees,clients, etc
actual implementation
acquire all resources to implement hardware/software etc
educating teams

implementation schedule

prepare changeover schedule (most systems its common to introduce one system at a time in a phased manner, so it easier to identify problems)
parallel systems, trail systems and slowly increasing rollout, finally to commision a new system

## Use/Evaluation Phase

using the system (feedback from users/customers)
auditing the system (creating internal audits/checks/metrics)
maintaince
re-enginnering
